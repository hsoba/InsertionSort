# InsertionSort

Analysis:
• The outer loop is used to pick the value we want to insert into the
sorted array in left.
• The value we want to insert we have picked and saved in a temp
variable.
• The inner loop is doing the comparison using the more() function.
The values are shifted to the right until we find the proper position
of the temp value for which we are doing this iteration.
• Finally, the value is placed into the proper position. In each iteration
of the outer loop, the length of the sorted array increase by one.
When we exit the outer loop, the whole array is sorted.
